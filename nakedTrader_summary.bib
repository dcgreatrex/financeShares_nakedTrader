  abstract =      {Although it is increasingly accepted that temporal
                   expectation can modulate early perceptual processing,
                   the underlying neural computations remain unknown. In
                   the present study, we combined a psychophysical
                   paradigm with electrophysiological recordings to
                   investigate the putative contribution of
                   low-frequency oscillatory activity in mediating the
                   modulation of visual perception by temporal
                   expectation. Human participants judged the
                   orientation of brief targets (visual Gabor patterns
                   tilted clockwise or counterclockwise) embedded within
                   temporally regular or irregular streams of
                   noise-patches used as temporal cues. Psychophysical
                   results indicated that temporal expectation enhanced
                   the contrast sensitivity of visual targets. A
                   diffusion model indicated that rhythmic temporal
                   expectation modulated the signal-to-noise gain of
                   visual processing. The concurrent
                   electrophysiological data revealed that the phase of
                   delta oscillations overlying human visual cortex
                   (1--4 Hz) was predictive of the quality of target
                   processing only in regular streams of events.
                   Moreover, in the regular condition, the optimum phase
                   of these perception-predictive oscillations occurred
                   in anticipation of the expected events. Together,
                   these results show a strong correspondence between
                   psychophysical and neurophysiological data,
                   suggesting that the phase entrainment of
                   low-frequency oscillations to external sensory cues
                   can serve as an important and flexible mechanism for
                   enhancing sensory processing.},
